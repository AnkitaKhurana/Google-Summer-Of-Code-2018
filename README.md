# Google-Summer-Of-Code-2018
This repository includes my work summary and my experience during Google Summer of Code 2018 with Hotosm (Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team) https://www.hotosm.org/ Sub Organisation under the Umbrella Organisation Digital Impact Alliance (DIAL) https://digitalimpactalliance.org/

My work was split into two major parts:

1. Building the APIs for the OpenAerialMap Administration which was made on Node.js using Hapi framework working with a MongoDB Database.Unit Testing using Chai, Sinon and Mocha.

2. Building Front End for the OpenAerialMap Administration which was made using the javascript library React and Redux. Unit testing using Tape and enzyme. 

# [oam-api](https://github.com/hotosm/oam-api)
This repository is associated with the APIs for OAM ADMIN. My work included making a new Admin Model which works on data stored in MongoDB. The Model handles functions that Administrator can perform. Further work on the APIs included Admin authentication which was done using Hapi Strategies and providing routes for the Oam -Admin frontend. The routes and models were tested using Mocha Chai and Sinon. This repository earlier supported the Users and the Images Logic of the Openearial Maps, work done by me was on the Administrator logic part.

# [oam-admin](https://github.com/AnkitaKhurana/oam-admin)
This repository is associated with the front end part of the Openaerialmap Administration. The Libraries used are Redux with React. The testing was done using testing utility Enzyme with a TAP-producing test library Tape. 
This repository was made from scratch dedicated purely to Administrator frontend for GSoC 2018.

# My Experience 
One word which can fully summarise my overall experience with Google summer of code and Hotosm organisation is Exposure. Working on an open source project was challenge on its own. Communication shifts entirely to Online platforms, which helps you to understand a lot of things about the way people work in a different part of the world. I learned a lot during this summer, got introduced to new frameworks, technologies. It is so much more than just writing code, I was working for people who are involved in humanitarian actions through open mapping to provide map data which revolutionised disaster management, reduced risks, and contributed to achievement of the Sustainable Development, the small contribution I was making made me feel proud and happy. Other things that I learned during this period is Time management, and understanding your code and not just implementing it. This summer proved to be very productive and fun. Thanks to this amazing program!

# [My Mentor, Sean Harkins](https://github.com/sharkinsspatial)
GSoC wouldn't have been possible for me without him. Mr.Sean proved to be an amazing mentor. He guided me in every phase of GSoC with complete dedication. He was always one mail away. And helped me understand things I was totally unfamiliar with. I had an amazing time working under him. Thanks again to the most amazing mentor, you are a lifesaver!
